Create a simple website that will display the weather report for a city. The website should have a list box (or some dynamic method) from which a user can select the following city names (New York, Chicago, Seattle, Houston, San Diego). By selecting a city a user should see the weather report for that city: date, max and min temperature, pressure, humidity etc. The website should be production deployable in terms of design, code quality, testing, and deployment instructions. You can use whichever Javascript framework/library you prefer (although React or Angular would be preferred if you have no other preference).

Dress to impress… any additional flourishes to show a complex technique technique or cool UI hack is encouraged. (We recognize it’s a coding assignment and you don’t want to waste hours on it, but showing something beyond the basics is encouraged.)
